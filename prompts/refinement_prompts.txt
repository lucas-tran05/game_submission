=== REFINEMENT & DEBUGGING PROMPTS ===

Prompt 1: Balance Adjustments
"The game feels too easy to achieve good endings. Adjust stat impact values to create more meaningful trade-offs. Each choice should have clear opportunity costs. Review all 10 events and rebalance impacts so players must sacrifice one area to benefit another."

Prompt 2: Climate Realism
"Verify that temperature and sea level calculations are based on realistic climate science. Current formula: tempIncrease = (100 - environment) / 100 * 0.3. Is this realistic for a 10-year period? Adjust if needed to match IPCC projections."

Prompt 3: NPC Letter Variety
"The NPC letters feel repetitive. Create more diverse character voices and responses:
- Different age groups (youth, working age, elderly)
- Different professions (fisherman, teacher, business owner, farmer)
- Different tones (grateful, worried, angry, hopeful)
Ensure letters reflect cumulative decisions, not just the last choice."

Prompt 4: UI Polish
"Review the game UI for visual improvements:
- Are stat bars clear and intuitive?
- Do colors convey meaning effectively?
- Is the chart readable and informative?
- Are buttons visually distinct?
- Is spacing and alignment consistent?
Suggest specific CSS improvements."

Prompt 5: Mobile Responsiveness Testing
"Test the game on mobile devices and fix issues:
- Are buttons large enough for touch?
- Is text readable on small screens?
- Do letters overlay properly?
- Does the chart render correctly?
- Are there any layout breaks?
Provide mobile-specific CSS fixes."

Prompt 6: Performance Bottlenecks
"Profile the game for performance issues:
- Are there unnecessary DOM manipulations?
- Is the chart update causing lag?
- Are transitions smooth on slower devices?
- Are there memory leaks when replaying?
Optimize any problematic code sections."

Prompt 7: Edge Case Handling
"Test and fix edge cases:
- What happens if a stat reaches exactly 0?
- What if multiple stats reach 0 simultaneously?
- What if player rapidly clicks choices?
- What if chart canvas is missing?
- What if browser doesn't support ES6?
Add appropriate error handling."

Prompt 8: Narrative Coherence
"Review all 10 events for narrative flow:
- Do events build upon each other logically?
- Are there contradictions in the storyline?
- Do later events reference earlier decisions?
- Is the difficulty curve appropriate?
- Do endings feel earned based on choices made?
Suggest improvements to story progression."

Prompt 9: Accessibility Audit
"Conduct accessibility review:
- Test with keyboard-only navigation
- Check color contrast ratios (WCAG AA standard)
- Verify screen reader compatibility
- Test with browser zoom at 200%
- Check focus indicators
Provide ARIA labels and semantic improvements."

Prompt 10: Cross-Browser Compatibility
"Test on different browsers and fix compatibility issues:
- Chrome/Edge (Chromium)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Mobile browsers
Check for CSS property support, JavaScript API availability, and render differences."

Prompt 11: Loading State Management
"Add loading state for Chart.js CDN:
- Show loading indicator while library loads
- Handle load failure gracefully
- Provide fallback if CDN is blocked
- Initialize chart only after library is ready
Prevent errors if Chart.js doesn't load."

Prompt 12: Tutorial/Onboarding
"Improve the 'How to Play' screen:
- Make instructions clearer and more concise
- Add visual examples or diagrams
- Highlight key mechanics
- Explain winning conditions
- Show sample choice with impact preview
Make it easier for new players to understand the game."

Prompt 13: Feedback Clarity
"Make game feedback more immediate and clear:
- Animate stat changes prominently
- Add sound effects or visual flashes (optional)
- Show +/- numbers floating up from stats
- Highlight which stats changed and by how much
- Make climate chart updates more noticeable
Help players understand the immediate impact of their choices."

Prompt 14: Ending Variety Testing
"Test that all 5 endings are achievable and distinct:
- Play through multiple times with different strategies
- Verify ending thresholds are balanced
- Ensure ending descriptions are sufficiently different
- Check that endings match player's choices
- Adjust thresholds if any ending is too easy/hard to achieve"

Prompt 15: Text Localization Quality
"Review Vietnamese translations for:
- Cultural appropriateness
- Natural phrasing (not direct translation)
- Consistency in terminology
- Formal vs informal tone appropriateness
- Grammar and spelling
Ensure text feels authentically Vietnamese, not translated."

Prompt 16: Data Persistence
"Should we add save game functionality?
- Consider localStorage for save states
- Allow players to resume interrupted games
- Track multiple playthroughs
- Store achievement/ending unlock progress
Weigh benefits vs added complexity for a short game."

Prompt 17: Debug Mode
"Create a debug/testing mode:
- Skip to specific years
- Set stats to specific values
- Test specific endings
- View all events quickly
- Export decision history
Make it easy to test all game paths without playing through completely."

Prompt 18: Code Cleanup
"Refactor code for maintainability:
- Extract magic numbers to constants
- Break large functions into smaller ones
- Add JSDoc comments to functions
- Remove unused code
- Improve variable naming
- Add code organization comments
Make code easier to understand and modify."

Prompt 19: Final Polish Pass
"Do a final polish pass on all elements:
- Fix any typos in text
- Ensure consistent capitalization
- Align all visual elements perfectly
- Test all animations for smoothness
- Verify all colors match the palette
- Check that all buttons have hover states
Make everything feel professional and cohesive."
